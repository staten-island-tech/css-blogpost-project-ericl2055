        <p>Inflation is a rise in prices, which can be translated as the decline of purchasing power over time. The rate at which purchasing power drops can be reflected in the average price increase of a basket of selected goods and services over some period of time. The rise in prices, which is often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods. Inflation can be contrasted with deflation, which occurs when prices decline and purchasing power increases - Investopedia</p>

        <p>
          Colleges and schools give a lot of homework to the student. Students often do it incorrectly because they don’t have enough information and knowledge. Sometimes students get new and unknown tasks to complete. Even at home, students are unable to find anyone to assist. These types of practices make things worse. Facts are overwhelming nowadays, which is one of the reasons why homework should be banned.
